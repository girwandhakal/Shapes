# C++ Polymorphism Project: 3D Shapes

## Overview
This project explores **polymorphism in C++** by defining a **base class (`Shape`)** and implementing four **derived classes** (`Sphere`, `Cylinder`, `Torus`, and `Box`). The goal is to enable the **main function to work independently** of the actual shape classes by leveraging **virtual functions**.
